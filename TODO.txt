The client side via collective.zopeedit on Ubuntu (and probably any other
recent Linux distro) is currently totally fucked in Chromium unless you a) set
editor=something and b) set extension=.noextension in ZopeEdit.ini.  Why, you
ask?

Chromium delegates to the operating system to choose which application to open
when a file cannot be handled by the browser itself, and is downloaded as a
result.  The fun part: the mimetype provided by in the response from the server
is simply thrown away when Chromium figures out it can't handle the mimetype
all by itself, and that it needs to punt to the OS.  It's not even set as an
extended attribute of the downloaded file.  It's just gone.

After downloading the file and throwing the mimetype away, Chromium punts to
the operating system to figure out which application should be used to open the
downloaded file.  Which means the "xdg-open" program.  xdg-open uses the
"Shared Mime Info" specification
(http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/shared-mime-info-spec-latest.html)
to choose which application to open given a file.  xdg-open cannot be given a
hint about the file's mimetype because clearly that would make life far too
easy.  And Chromium *does not* set the ``user.mime_type`` attribute on the
downloaded file (not that it would matter, because the version of xdg-open on
Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't take it into account anyway, even though the spec says it
should).  Instead, it only takes a filename or a URL as a single argument, and
then attempts to divine the mimetype from that argument.  xdg-open on Ubuntu
(really gvfs-open, because xdg-open is just a wrapper around it) will first
consult the mime database using the file extension of the file.  If a mimetype
is associated with the extension, it's game over.  In practice, this means that
if the downloaded file extension is ``.txt``, gedit is going to be used to open
the file, fucking full stop.  Game over, glad you played.

However, we don't *want* gedit to be used to open the file, we want zopeedit to
be used to open the file.  This means that we have to manufacture a phony
extension that isn't associated with any mimetype in the shared mime database,
so that the *magic* computation of the shared mimeinfo database will begin to
come into play.  Once the magic computation comes into play,
"application/x-zope-edit" will always be found as the mimetype due to the magic
rule in the "zopeedit.xml" file.  Good enough.

So now we're able to download the file as a ``.zem`` file and zopeedit gets
launched.  In the meantime, however, collective.zopeedit copies the file to a
tempfile using its original filename (which ends with .zem), and *it* wants to
use gvfs-open to figure out which file to launch if ``editor`` is not set.  And
since the filename ends in ``.zem`` it chooses zopeedit!  Total clusterfuck.

In practice, this means, on Ubuntu, in Chromium:

- We have to tack on a .zem extension to the downloaded filename by using
  ``name=edit.zem`` in the server-side source code.

- We have to set ``extension=.noeextension`` in the ZopeEdit.ini file to
  prevent zopeedit from trying to open a ``.zem`` file using gvfs-open and
  recursing itself to death.

There are similar fuckages using Firefox, although I believe Firefox has some
sort of way of associating a mimetype with an external program, so it may
behave slightly better.

Windows and MacOS are completely different animals.  No idea.

You might think an option would be to cause the client to accept a *URL*
instead of a filename.  The URL can have a custom scheme
(e.g. ``zopeedit://localhost:6543/foo/bar.txt``).  Then we can associate the
scheme with an application, which will be fed the URL.  But this has problems
too because the program that is fed the URL wont have the proper credentials to
download the file.

So at this point I see no other option but to change collective.zopeedit to
munge the filename it uses to create a copy of the downloaded file in a temp
location to get rid of /edit.zem or at least tack on the original extension of
the downloaded file.

What was so bad about configurable browser helper apps again?
